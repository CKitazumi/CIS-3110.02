# html-bootstrap-deliverables

**Deliverable 1**
# Using the html & bootstrap methods learned in class, I created a functioning website with dropdown menus and a working hovering button that links to my personal github account!

**Deliverable 2**
# Using the momentum from the first deliverable I applied the methods of writing cookies and therefore creating a user authenticated based page that connects to my html bootstrapped website that allows users to access the site using cookies.
